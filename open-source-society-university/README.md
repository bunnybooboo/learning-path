This a great initiative from OSS to bring together a ton of MOOCs into a coherent framework
to assist learning along a path toward Computer Science level. It's all published via Github
and the website is currently in Alpha.

You can start the courses right away as they are all edX, Coursera etc. I've watched hours of
the videos already (All of CS60 from Harvard for example) but submitted little coursework.

Adding this to my learning path to encourage myself to get back to it.
