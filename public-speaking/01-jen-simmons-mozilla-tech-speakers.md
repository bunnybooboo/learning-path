##### 4 Tips to Prepare for Public Speaking
1. WHAT is it you are going to say and WHO to
2. WHERE will you be speaking
3. PREPARE the best way to communicate to them
4. DO IT

##### Notes
* Take advice from sources that resonate with you
* There is no 'one way' to achieve the best result
* Find your own voice
* A speech is not a thesis - you will not be scored on it
* Just start - try the idea out
* Great talks often come from testing on smaller audiences first
* You may feel frustrated
* Work on articulating better next time
* Try to get videos of your talks
* Detach emotionally when reviewing
* Watch other people
* Notice tone, speed, style
* Trust yourself
* You don't have to fit someone's mould to get an audience
* To get up there is hard
* Start preparing way ahead of time
* 3-5 times redoing it is ideal
* ..but procrastination **will** get in the way
* You may not always have as much time to prepare as you'd hoped
* Watch out for internal dialogue which may derail you
* Listen to how the dialogue tries to bring doubt
* Cut to the chase - is the internal dialogue reflecting the real situation
* You will get stronger
* It might feel like you might die but it's highly unlikely
* Look fear right in the face
