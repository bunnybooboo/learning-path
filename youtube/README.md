There are so many great tutorials out there on Youtube. Recently I've been greatly helped by

1. [Derek Banas]{https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas} - you'll find a subfolder of his awesome stuff. Great for binge watching.
2. [Dan Sheffner]{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4WhCLLXHL-3LCECNQBphgg} - his very detailed tutorial on KVM had me up and running in minutes when I had failed for days
3. [Will Stern]{https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy} - another one to binge watch. In fact I had him running at 2x speed and still could make out what he was saying. Part of my Javascript binge month.
4. [Eli the Computer Guy]{https://www.youtube.com/user/elithecomputerguy/} - well of course. I'm sure this guy never sleeps.
