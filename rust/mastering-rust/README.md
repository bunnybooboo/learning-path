Initialising Packt Publishing repo to track notes on reading [Mastering Rust](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-rust) ISBN 9781785885303, released 30 May 2017. Purchased this over Christmas when they had a 5 for £25 offer. Good timing as it is normally £39.58.

This expands on another book of theirs I've been working through: 'Rust Essentials'. Notes from that book can be found at [Rust Essentials Notes](/rust/rust-essentials/notes.md)
