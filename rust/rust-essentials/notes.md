# Personal notes from the Pack book 'Rust Essentials'

I've gone for Rust installed via Rustup. It's Rust-lang's version manager. It allows me to have stable and nightly installed and instantly switchable. Added to this is the possibility of using specific versions for specific builds. Great tool for development.

As I'm using Arch Linux the terminal command to install Rustup is `sudo pacman -Sy rustup`. For other version head over to https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs

Rust uses a similar compilation method to C (clang) where you would make >> install >> execute. The one for Rust is called rustc, where you write >> compile >> execute.

Rust uses a package and dependency manager called Cargo. This in my brain at least is starting to building something more along the lines of Ruby Gems. I've done a rather brief tutorial on Ruby on Rails so excuse my ignorance if I've technically not got that right. Please feel free to correct me in any of my writings!
