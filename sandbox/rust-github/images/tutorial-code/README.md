My attempt at re-engineering Ruby code from Building Tools with Github tutorial - Gollum image push and review - to Rust

Note this may contain fragments from the original repo as I'm still completing this effort.

To Do:
  [x] - Readme
  [x] - index.html
  [ ] - Github API
  [ ] - OAuth2
  [ ] - Web Framework
  [ ] - Zip files
  [ ] - Tempfiles
