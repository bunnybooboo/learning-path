# learning-path
My personal learning path.

Starting a new workflow for myself. Whilst watching a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fju9ii8YsGs I started working through the workshop in Atom and saving each module as a separate file.

After doing a few I though to simultaneously start working with git to increase my everyday use of it. I hope this will also show accountability to myself of what I've learned and credit where from.

Start NOW: Take ACTION etc..

Connected Atom using `git config --global core.editor 'atom --wait`

My first great idea!

This idea is even better..

Change on github.com to show commit changes

Now this is a change on my laptop! Wahoo.
