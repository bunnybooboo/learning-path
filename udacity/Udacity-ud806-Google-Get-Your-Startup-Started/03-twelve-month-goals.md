## 12 Month Goals

### Set Goals
1. How many customers?
2. How much revenue?
3. What metrics?

### Strategy
1. Imagine any progress
2. Set timeframe
3. Adjust to 12 months

### Examples
* If 10 customers in first month seems reasonable then 120 would be achievable
* Or if 5,000 at year 5 seems workable then 1,000 in first 12 months a good goal
