In the previous Javascript video in this series I tried working through each part.

It took hours and got frustrating. To break it up I started watching this one and found my brain liked it.
This time I will try simply copying in the full code and later working through examples on any
I don't already understand.

The Coursera "Learning How to Learn" mentions that cognitively we can't deep dive too early or it won't sink in.
Maybe that's why my brain was getting tired. Whilst I knew much of the first video some of it was new. Bombarding
myself with to much new info put up a mental block.

Again instead of giving up I just pushed ahead with something related. Seems to have worked so far.
