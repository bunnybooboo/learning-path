## Criteria for Effective Segmentation
* homogenous
* heterogeneous
* measurable
* substantial
* accessible
* practical/actionable
* responsive

#### Homogeneous
Customers allocated to each segment should be similar in some way. The cornerstone of market segmentation. Similar in needs or characteristics.
#### Heterogeneous
Each segment should be fairly unique when comapred against the other segements. This then identifies that the segementation has driven deep enough to unveil varying needs.
#### Measurable
Some form of data should be available to measure to size of the market. Data is essential to identify overal market attractiveness.
#### Substantial
The segment must be large enough in terms of sales and profitability to warrant attention. Each business will have minimum requirements for ROI so it's important to only have interest in substantial segements.
#### Accessible
Market should be reachable especially in regards to communicating to the market and with distribution.
#### Actionable/Practical
Business needs to have resources to be able to target the group. Some segements may therefore be out of scope.
#### Responsive
Each segment should be likely to react to targetting vs generalisation. If segements do not respond to targetting they are ripe for combining with similar segements.
