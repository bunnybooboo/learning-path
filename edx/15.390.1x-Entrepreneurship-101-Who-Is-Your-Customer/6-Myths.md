### 6 Myths of Entrepreneurship

1. Entrepreneurs are born, not made.
Concrete skills can increase odds of success, such as management sales, and product consumption.

2. Individuals start companies. Teams start companies and a bigger team can increase odds of success.

3. Entrepreneurs are the smartest people in the room. Focus and dedication make for a successful entrepreneur.

4. All leaders are charismatic and it's key to their success. More than charisma, successful entrepreneurs exhibit vision, systemic thinking, analytic skills, outstanding execution skills, and a blend of humility and ambition.

5. Entrepreneurs love risk. Most entrepreneurs don't like gambling as their is no control over the outcome. Great entrepreneurs prefer intelligent risk taking. Maneuvering to eliminate as much risk as possible, and only taking calculated risks where the outcome might be influenced.

6. Entrepreneurs are undisciplined. Successful entrepreneurs must have extreme self-discipline as they have few resources, no reputation, and a very finite time in which to succeed.
