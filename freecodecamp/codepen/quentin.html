        <p>Quentin Crisp (1908-1999) was a man loved by the media for his intelligent storytelling and camp individualism, perfect fodder for occasional controversial soundbite. Thrown out of the army for having far too much fun, Crisp was certainly not the shy and retiring type. Eternally expressing his flamboyant homosexuality, the moralistic framework of the mid 20th century struggled to contain him for long. His creative output spanned numerous books, films, television appearances, even the subject of Sting's song 'Englishman in New York' (..Nothing Like the Sun, 1987).</p>

        <p>A critic of the gay scene, Diana, Princess of Wales, and housework, to name just a few targets of his wit. Crisp decided to have his home telephone number listed in the phonebook, welcoming all conversations, clearly enjoying the random vibrance that society could share with him.</p>
