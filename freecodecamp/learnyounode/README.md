Locally saved files getting me through this. After attending the workshop from the guys at http://www.meetup.com/NodeWorkshops/ I then realised this is now part of Freecodecamp's curriculum. Win!

I found this really really hard on the night. Potentially it's down to the way the help files are worded. I broke it down pushed ahead and got there in the end. Advanced a couple of modules through it.

Little celebration dance required. Yes actually.
